                <div class="letter-body">
                    <p>My Favourite Person,</p>
            
                    <p>It has been years, yet the echo of your voice still lingers in my soul.  
                    I find you in the quiet of the night, where memories weave themselves into my dreams.  
                    The world moves on, but my heart remains suspended in the moment our eyes last met.</p>
            
                    <p>2017 feels like yesterday—your laughter, a melody I still hum; your presence, a warmth I never stopped craving.  
                    Do you ever watch the stars and wonder if somewhere, someone is missing you?  
                    Because every night, I whisper your name to the moon, hoping it carries my longing across the skies to you.</p>

                    <p>I will forever cherish the time and moments we had together, etched in the corners of my heart like a beautiful, untouchable dream.</p>
            
                    <p>If time were kind, it would have folded its arms around us, never letting us drift apart.  
                    But if distance is the price of knowing you, I would pay it a thousand times over.</p>
            
                    <p>Wherever you are, know that someone, somewhere, still treasures you beyond words.  
                    And should fate ever be merciful, I hope we meet again—not in dreams, but beneath the same sky,  
                    where my heart has always waited for you.</p>
            
                    <p>Until fate rewrites our story, I will meet you in dreams, where time stands still and love never fades. </p>
                    <p><strong>Vin Lydez - The one who never forgot.</strong></p>
